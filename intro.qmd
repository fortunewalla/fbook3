# Introduction

This is a book created from markdown and executable code.

GH Actions is working but now need to create a preview local & then upload it fully there.

1) Create `fbook` book project in quarto
2) No need to render it locally. Perhaps only preview.
3) `git init` & add required token, `user.name` & `user.email`
4) Create repo on GH `fbook`
5) Type this: 
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/fortunewalla/fbook.git
git branch -M main

```
6) git add . && git commmit -m "initial" & git push -u origin main

7) git add . && git commmit -m "initial" & git push --set-upstream origin main

8) Create `gh-pages` branch in GH repo.

9) mkdir & create file .github/workflows/publish-quarto.yml

10) GH Actions File. Don't copy the file from GH Actions Samples Example repo. It has some YAML error.
The below works.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Quarto Publish

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tinytex: true        
      # From https://github.com/actions/setup-python
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
          cache: 'pip'
      - run: pip install jupyter
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
	  
      # From https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v2-branch/setup-r
      - name: Setup R
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: '4.4.0'

      - name: Install R Dependencies
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2
        with:
          cache-version: 1
	  - name: Render and Publish
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

```

11) git add . && git commmit -m "added publish-quarto.yml" & git push -u origin main

12) GH Settings -> Pages -> Branch change to `gh-pages` & directory as `/root` and then save.
